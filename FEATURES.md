# Chatty — feature log

Short notes on what we add and why, so the proxy stays intentional as it grows.

## Agent-grade OpenAI compatibility (`/v1/chat/completions`)

### Added

Forwarding of `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls`, and `response_format` to Groq; `messages` are accepted as OpenAI-shaped JSON objects (`list` of dicts), not only `{role, content}` strings.

### Why

Clients using the official OpenAI SDK for **tool calling** and **JSON / structured output** send these fields and multi-turn messages (assistant `tool_calls`, tool results with `tool_call_id`). A strict `role`+`content`-only model dropped those fields and blocked agent flows. Passing dict messages and the extra kwargs keeps Chatty a true drop-in for Groq-backed agents without changing the server architecture.

### Docs

Request body still follows the subset documented in the app; unsupported fields should be omitted by clients or Groq may reject them.
